# Correlation of major EU economies' stock indices

This repository contains the code for reproducing the results of my submission to the DSIER class. Here, I study the correlation between the major stock indices of the 10 largest EU economies (measured in terms of GDP, source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe_by_GDP_(nominal))).

The list of countries and indices can be found under `data/indices.csv`. Due to data scarcity, Poland (ranked #6) removed due to data scarcity and the 11th largest economy, Austria, was instead chosen to replace it.

## Requirements
